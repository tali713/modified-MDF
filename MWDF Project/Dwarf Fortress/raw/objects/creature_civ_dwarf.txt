	Many of the following tags are actually caste-level tags (in this case, male and female), but because there are no differences between the castes for these tags in a dwarf, you can add them earlier.  Any caste-level tag that occurs before castes are explicitly declared is saved up and placed on any caste that is declared later, unless the caste is explicitly derived from another caste.

	Next we use body detail plans (which have their own raw file) to streamline the addition of some of the common materials, tissues and their relationships with each other.

	[RELSIZE:BY_CATEGORY:LIVER:300] Of course!  Standard relative size for humanoids is 200.

	Tendons and ligaments are currently very abstract, but adding these flags will let wounds occur that damage them.  The number afterward is the healing rate.  Lower is faster.

	[TENDONS:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:SINEW:200]
	[LIGAMENTS:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:SINEW:200]

	This makes the creature susceptible to severed nerves when muscles are torn in limb, grasp and stance parts.

	[HAS_NERVES]

	This controls the bleeding behavior.

	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:BLOOD:BLOOD_TEMPLATE]
	[BLOOD:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:BLOOD:LIQUID]

	These classes are used by syndromes (such as poison) as well as some restricted entity positions.  You can name them whatever you want.

	Attributes for dwarves are still described in terms of the median value below, but the actual game effects are altered according to the raw numbers.  The numbers are different percentile values.  1000 is the human median for all attributes, so dwarven strength, for instance, has a higher median of 1250, although they suffer from their smaller size.

	These tags establish the growth phases of the creature's life.  The format is (BODY_SIZE|<year>|<day>|<average size>).

	[BODY_SIZE:0:0:3000]
	[BODY_SIZE:1:168:15000]
	[BODY_SIZE:12:0:60000]

	These body modifiers give individual dwarves different characteristics.  In the case of HEIGHT, BROADNESS and LENGTH, the modifier is also a percentage change to the BODY_SIZE of the individual creature.  The seven numbers afterward give a distribution of ranges.  Each interval has an equal chance of occurring.

	[ATTACK:PUNCH:BODYPART:BY_TYPE:GRASP]
		[ATTACK_SKILL:GRASP_STRIKE]

		This means that the attack will use as much of the available tissue as possible, rather than, say, thrusting with a spike.

	Here, GENERAL_BABY_NAME is at the creature level, and BABYNAME is at the caste level.  These names could be gender-specific but aren't right now.
