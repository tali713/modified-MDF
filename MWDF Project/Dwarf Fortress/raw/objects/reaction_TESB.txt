========== PART 1 ==========
==== TRIBUTE REACTIONS =====
============================

These reactions allow a dwarf to sacrifice an appropriate gem to receive protection against a specific caste of Awakened Stones.  That functionality is handled by a reaction-trigger which applies a specific permanent syndrome.
The sacrifice can be any large gem, or a regular cut gem made from the "hidden gem" associated with that stone.  For example, a tribute to granite can be a small hidden emerald or any large gem.  A hidden gem *can* be used as a large gem, but that's wasteful.
But first, a handful of reactions to handle Tributes and Altars constructed inappropriately.
