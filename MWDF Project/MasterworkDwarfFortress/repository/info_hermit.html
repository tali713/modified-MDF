	<h1>General Info</h1>
	<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Your hermit can learn any skill in the game, just like a normal dwarf. He starts with 0 skill points, making the start somewhat harder.</p>
	<p><strong>Combat: </strong>You will want to stay out of combat if possible. You are alone and no one will come to help you, when you are unconscious and bleeding out. </p>
	<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> You favor the bow, both as hunting weapon and in war. It allows you to keep your distance. Otherwise you have axes, swords, hammers and spears. Choose the right weapon for the right opponent.</p>
	<p><strong>Ammo:</strong> Arrows. You can poison them for even more uses. Paralyzing poisons are the best.</p>
	<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Normal leather or metal armor. Get as much as you can, layers over layers. </p>
	<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Normal materials, nothing new.</p>
	<p><strong>Pets:</strong> You can take any pet that the dwarf civilization has access to. </p>
	<p><strong>Food:</strong> Should be easy, since you only have one person to feed. Hunt, fish, butcher, farm, gather... as you like.</p>
	<p><strong>Drink:</strong> Only dwarves are alcohol-dependent, if you play a hermit of a different race, water is perfectly fine.</p>
	<p><strong>Digging:</strong> Same as dwarves, please bring a pick at embark.Otherwise you have to wait till invaders come, kill some, melt their gear and forge your own pick.</p>
	<p><strong>Embark:</strong> Same as always, although water-access is fairly important for the hermit.</p>
	<p><strong>Nobles:</strong> You got one noble, and that is you. He does all jobs, although he will never use the justice or healthcare system. But you can use the bookkeeper, broker, manager, militia commander and diplomat. Its all in one. Due to a bug in DF I had to add militia captain and sheriff as well, since these are mutually exclusive. Your hermit will end up being all three, as you like.                </p>
	<p><strong>Religion: </strong>You can build a house shrine and pray, spawning items that are needed for moods. It's not really important, since almost no hermits can craft artefacts; except if you play as one of the main races like dwarves, humans, kobolds, orcs or succubi.</p>
