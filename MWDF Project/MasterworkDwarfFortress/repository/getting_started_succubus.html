<title>Succubi - Getting Started</title>
<style></style>
</head>

<body>
<div style="max-width:804px;margin:auto;">
	<h1 style="text-align: left;">Getting started</h1>
	<p style="text-align: left;">The succubi use a mix of surface and underground features. They enjoy expansive palace where dark stone and gem windows meet decorated furniture. &nbsp;Each fort in their kingdom must be treated as a work of art.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">But the finely decorated bedrooms hide a darker secret. In the underground, dark temples maintain a link between the surface and the horrors below, enabling the succubi to summon powerful monsters while the witches sacrify the souls of their enemies for their own leisure, or their enemies pain.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">If possible, succubi prefer to embark on evil biomes. They particulary enjoy drinking wine made from evil plants and their cattle does not suffer there. Beward of the undead who will never understand desires the way lust demons do.</p>
	<h2>The embark preparation </h2>
	<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">You will be able to live with a standard inventory. However you have to keep in mind that sieges will start very early. So it is a good idea to prepare one of your original succubi as a trained fighter.</span></strong></p>
	<h3><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span>Skills</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Same as dwarves for 6 succubi: miners,&nbsp;lumberjack,&nbsp;carpenter,&nbsp;mason,&nbsp;farmer</li>
		<li>Idealy one combat capable succubus to appoint as lady of pain.</li>
		<li>Do not separate organizer and bookkeeper. The keeper of secrets fill both roles.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><strong>Items</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Standard items a regular fort uses. What worked for dwarves will for for the succubi.</li>
		<li>Your succubi are not alcohol dependant so drinks are not as vital if there is water.</li>
		<li>You can buy surface plants at the embark screen.</li>
		<li>A weapon and an helmet to equip your lady of pain. Bronze is the best budget metal.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><strong>Pets</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Tentacle monsters are expensive but will provides an oil substitute, sets contaminant traps and are good fighters.</li>
		<li>Orthus are similar to dogs but stronger, they can serve as bodyguards.</li>
		<li>Nahashes or rat things will hunt vermins around.</li>
		<li>You will start with 2 cauchemars. Those can follow in simple fights or provide your with early milk.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>First things on the map </h2>
	<p style="text-align: left;">First appoit your lady of pain and create a squad for her. Get her to train quickly and give her 2 sparring mates after the first migration wave. Be careful of her happines however, digging a room for her and making early furniture with your carpenter is a good idea.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Otherwise the standard procedure to securing your supplies and making the fort sustainable and defended apply. You must keep in mind that 'good' guys are on the way so a drawbridge and basic defences are a priority.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Afterwards you can slaughter your starting cauchemars. Turn their skulls into totems and you will be able to build a summoning circle and start bringing extra beasts. Their souls can be used at the temple of sin to offer a couple of extra moves to your warriors.</p>
	<h2>Advancing </h2>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Build a jeweler workshop and start cutting gems. Those will let you conserve souls at the Soul Well. Large gems also allow you to summon fire imps.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">You can also make a   worker fire immune and start   digging space for a magma reservoir with a magma well designed to pour   into it. Use your fire immune succubi to summon magma. Buliding your   furnaces on top of those will unlock most of the industry.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">As an alternative to immigrants, making a large quantity of cage traps will allow you to turn prisoners into more succubi. Build their cage near a den of iniquity and, afterwards, free them using a lever. Be careful that their mount will remain hostile no matter what.</p>
