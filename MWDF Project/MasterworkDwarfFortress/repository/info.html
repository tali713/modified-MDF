	<p><strong>General Info</strong></p>
	<p>Masterwork DF is a huge mod-pack that combines several major mods (playable races), minor mods (items, creatures, workshops), tilesets, utilities and dfhack scripts to one pack. Everything is pre-installed and it comes with its own launcher: The MasterworkDF GUI. It allows you to install or deinstall any part of the mod with a simple button click. In short: This is the StarterPack on crack!</p>
	<p>The entire vanilla DF content is still there and unchanged, which makes the mod easy to get into.</p>
	<p>Currently you can select one of five races to play: Dwarves, Kobolds, Orcs, Succubi and the Hermit. First one are the metalworkers and smiths you know and love; Kobolds are more tribal in nature, stay on the surface and rely on leather and wood as build materials; Orcs are both war-mongering steppe warriors as well as proud craftsmen and artisans; Succubi are evil demons that convert prisoners to their cause and summon monsters; while the Hermit mode allows you to play a single unit in fortress mode out of 200 intelligent races, be it Ogre, Bat Man, Goblin or Grimeling.</p>
	<p>Please skim through the rest of the manual to get an idea of the mod content. :)</p>
