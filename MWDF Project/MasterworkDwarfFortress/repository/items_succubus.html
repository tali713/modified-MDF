	<h1>Succubus - Items</h1>
	<h2>Weapons</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Lasher weapons : Whips (blunt) and bladed whips (edged).</li>
		<li>Piercing : Pitchforks, can be upgraded at the soul forge for more strength and ranged attacks.</li>
		<li>Blades : Large daggers, duel swords, long swords and claymore.</li>
		<li>Axes : Double edged axes and great axes.</li>
		<li>Ranged : Recurve bows for general support, stygian pitchforks can fire special shards that can explode or causes syndromes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Ammo</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Arrows</li>
		<li>Spell shard : Does less damage than ammo but special ones can be made at the soul forge.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Force shard : causes a cave in effect, knocking creatures out.</li>
		<li>Blight shard : creates severe necrosis clouds</li>
		<li>Pain shard : inflict pain to the affect creatures</li>
		<li>Make sure you properly set up the ammo in your military screen. Do not let your warriors train with special shard!</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
	<h2>Armor</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Standard gauntlets, boots and helmet.</li>
		<li>Corsets for the body. Those does not protect well but can be worn at the same time as a leather armor or a stolen breastplate.</li>
		<li>You can make chain mails from metal or bodysuits from leather for an additional layer of protection.</li>
		<li>Round shields. Setting the uniform on shield/buckler will let the succubi pick better shields from fallen enemies.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Improving armor</h2>
	<p>Several armor pieces like breastplates, greaves or high tier shields can not be built by the succubi. You can instead take it from (dead) invaders. Non decorated pieces can be improved at the soul forge. The increase in quality in doing so it tied to the worker's armorsmith skill, a legendary giving a guaranted masterpiece. You can only upgrade such a piece once as it will be decorated with soul gems in the process.</p>
	<h3>Civilian clothes</h3>
	<p>All the succubi civs have access to corsets, skirts and stockings. There is a low chance that the civilization also have access to head veils, masks, gloves, mittens, sandals and pants.</p>
	<p>Due to their... specific culture, the succubi are not affected by a lack of clothing like the other races. This means that you can set a military uniform to 'replace clothing' even if it is incomplete. Remember still that footwear is important to avoid contaminants.</p>
