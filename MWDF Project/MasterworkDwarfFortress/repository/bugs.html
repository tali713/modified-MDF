	<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
    <p>Some things cant be fixed or avoided in modding a game with a closed source code. If you experience wonky gameplay and general oddities have a look here, maybe its a known and already reported problem. There are usually workarounds available for you to fix it.</p>
    <p>If you cant find the source of your problems on the list, please come by bay12 and share. In almost all cases it is a typo or simple error in the raws that can be fixed in a future release.</p>

		<td>If a workshop is in a burrow, even if the burrow is inactive, then it accepts only materials within the same burrow.</td>
		</tr><tr>
		<td>Solution: </td>
		<td>Make a bigger burrow including the materials, or keep the material stockpiles within the same burrow. Or delete the burrow.</td>

		</tr><tr>
		<td>Solution: </td>
		<td>Open the GUI or Init.txt and set Temperature to ON. This can be done in a running fortress, you only have to restart DF. You do not need to gen a new world. You can also turn off &quot;smoke effects&quot; in the misc features section. This will decrease the amount of these boulders significantly.</td>

		<td>I have never been able to replicate this. It appears to be at random, with major differences in the PC system people use. Try shorter histories, &lt;100 years. If the problem persists, please leave a detailed report in the forum. Please mention the mod version, tileset used, if settings have been changed, and how much virtual memory/ram you have.</td>

		<td>Bug:</td>
		<td>The Dwarf Fortress main folder shows a errorlog.txt. This is created when certain entry in the raws are missing. In 90% of the cases this is completely harmless. It is caused by enabling some settings, and disabling other.<br>
		For example you remove warpstone. The error log will tell you that warpstone is missing in the reactions for warpstone landmines and turrets.</td>
		</tr><tr>
		<td>Solution: </td>
		<td>The default setting has no error log. If your setting has a very big error log, please leave me a message in the forum. Otherwise just ignore it, it will do no harm.</td>

		<td>Please report at the forum thread, or write me a PM. Please mention the mod version, tileset used, if settings have been changed, and what exactly is it that is wrong.<br>
		Please keep in mind that some issues are Vanilla DF or dfhack related. If you think this is the case, give me a quick heads up, but post the report in the fitting thread. Do mention that you play Masterwork DF though, otherwise people will get confused. Thank you.</td>
