	<h1><a name="k4" id="k">Wood Splitting Block</a></h1>

	<div></div>
	<p><strong>Build labor: Leatherworker</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Skill: </strong>Any</p>
	<p>The Breeding Warren allows any female kobold to get pregnant and give birth instantly. Kobold children come of age in only 1 year, so this is a great way to increase your civ member count. You just need 1 stack of meat to feed the newborn.</p>

	<h1><a name="a" id="a">Bone Chipper</a></h1>
	<p><img src="icons/bonechipper.png" width="63" height="105" alt="Alchemist" /></p>
	<p><strong>Build labor: </strong><strong>Leatherworker</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Skill: </strong>Bonecarver</p>
	<p>A workshop that upgrades bone to bonerattle, an armor-material that fools undeads into thinking that you are one of them. You can make bone armors and armorsets here, or upgrade and make bonerattle armor and armorsets. Keep in mind that every reaction uses up an entire stack of bones, so it is more economical to use the craftsbold for the bone armor. Once upgraded to bonerattle the reactions work normally, using one item for each product.</p>

	<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Herbalism</p>
	<p>Allows five kinds of plants to be bundled into wicker bales, with 2 plants used for one bale. These are used to create blocks for constructions or for furniture. For stockpiling reasons they are treated as stone. Bales are counted as tools, which means that your wicker bales can be found in stone tool stockpiles.</p>
	<p>Wicker bins are very light, keeping kobolds at a fast speed.</p>
	<hr />

	<p>Kobolds can also create shrapnel traps. These need 2 stacks of bones to be made, but hit 4 times with each attack.</p>

	<h1><a name="i" id="i">Woodcarver</a></h1>

	<p><strong>Build labor: </strong><strong>Leatherworker</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Woodcrafting</p>
	<p>A simple workshop that produces items of wood. Think of it as a carpentry for items the vanilla carpenter cant produce. Slabs, mechanisms, querns, millstones as well as batches of furniture can be done here, so can wooden braziers and candelabras.</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>Furnaces</h1>
	<hr />
	<h1>Crematory</h1>
	<p><img src="icons/buildings/crematory.PNG" width="48" height="48" alt="crematory" /></p>
	<div>Great for cleaning up your fort. You can burn all kinds of different items, including body parts and remains, any sort of items and wooden furniture to get some ash or charcoal out of it. Wooden items produce coal for sure, body parts/remains might leave ash, and all smaller items have a small chance for either.</div>
	<p>This is mostly done to reduce the amount of items, so it is nor very efficient in creating ash or coal. I advise to build one or two of these next to your refuse piles.          </p>
	<h1>Booze Burner</h1>
	<p><img src="icons/booze burner.png" width="53" height="88" alt="Alchemist" /></p>
	<p>Turns alcohol into fuel. Since kobolds have access to drinks, but are not dependent on them, you can use them to replenish your fuel resources without wasing valueable wood.</p>
	<h1>Totem Pole</h1>
	<p><img src="screenshots/totempole.png" width="49" height="49" alt="Alchemist" /></p>
	<p>Dance around the totem pole to control the weather. Let the sun shine, start rain or snow storms. The rain is especially interesting since it stops forest fires.</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>Training</h1>

	<h1><a name="32" id="32">Trap Parcour</a></h1>
	<p><img src="icons/trap running track.png" width="64" height="107" alt="Alchemist" /></p>
	<p><strong>Build labor: </strong><strong>Leatherworker</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Fighting and Doging skills</p>
	<p>Use this parcour to train your kobolds general skills, like throwing, dodging and coordination, as well as armor and shield. You need either a trap component or a shield/armor for these reactions. The items have a 5% chance of breaking.        </p>
	<hr />
	<h1><a name="38" id="38">Training Room</a></h1>

	<p>The training room allows melee combat training, as well as any weapon skill. You need one training weapon of the type, and you have a 5% chance to break it while training.</p>
