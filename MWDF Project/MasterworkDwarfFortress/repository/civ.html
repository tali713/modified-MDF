	<p>A unique feature of MDF are the multiple playable races. Not only sturdy and heavily drunk dwarves can be played, but also others. You can experience the game from the point of view of curious kobolds, evil warlocks and their undeads, demonic succubi, proud orcish warriors, human merchants and gnomish inventors. But what is the best race for you? What are the differences?</p>
	<p><strong>Dwarves - Best metalworkers, smiths and miners.</strong></p>
	<p>Dwarves have the most features. They are the closest to vanilla DF and masters smiths and metalworkers. They are the only race with direct access to the new metals, can make smelt batches of ore and are able to directly buy from merchants or embassies. Their weapons pack the hardest punch, and can be easily refined into masterpieces. They are the only race that can work Adamantine. Among the high-end features are rune inscriptions for weapons and armor, as well as magma-based metals.</p>
	<p>They are easy to learn and easy to play. They need alcohol to get through the working day.</p>
	<p><strong>Kobolds - Chaotic, fast-breeding with low life expectancy.</strong></p>
	<p>Kobolds are curious. And therefore die a lot. They live mostly on the surface and in caves. They build with leather and wood, re-using their tents dozens of times for different uses. Since they are carnivores, you will need meat or bones to feed them, which requires lifestock, hunting and fishing. They can drink alcohol, but get drunk quickly. They are also quick to die, but very resistant to tantrums, with a life expectancy of only 15 years, kobolds breed fast and populate their camps quickly. One of their main weapons is venom from their pets. They only trade with other kobolds though, making them a hard race to play.</p>
	<p>They are hard to play. They have no access to stone or metals. </p>
	<p><strong>Succubi - Dungeon-keeperesque demon race, charming invaders to stay.</strong></p>
	<p>Succubi are a female dominated civ of red demon ladies. In corsets and boots. I have your attention? Good. They are among the evil races, closely linked to demons. Summoning new pets from the underworld in exchange for the souls of your killed enemies is a basic feature. Different temples of sins and lust allow map-wide effects. Their speciality however is charming captured invaders to your side. You can enlargen your fort by turning your enemies into willing slaves.</p>
	<p>They are easy to learn and easy to play. They have few children and rely on converted prisoners.</p>
	<p><strong>Orcs - Good fighters and artisans.</strong></p>
	<p>Orcs are proud warriors and come in many different variations. Your camp setup will vary depending on your migrants, be it ranged-skilled snaga, mighty ologs, commanding uruks, raiding corsairs, crafty artisans or magical dreamwalkers. Larger than other races, they make combat seem easy. They specialize in both finely-made handcrafted tribal gear, as well as cheap makeshift mass production. Influenced with themes ranging from samurai to pirates, from mongols and atztecs, they make for good succession forts. Orcs often raid other civs and get sieged more often, which suits them just fine.</p>
	<p>They are easy to learn and easy to play. Being stronger than dwarves, they favor melee combat.</p>             
	<p><strong>THE NEXT ONES TO BE ADDED ARE:              </strong></p>
	<p><strong>Humans - Traders and diplomats with access to knights and blackpowder.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Necromancers - Evil mages that use corpses as main fortress material.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Tribe Fortress - Animal Men with stone age technology trying to survive.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Nagas, a water-based snake race... Insect hive, based on mutations... Plant or Rock civs... many options.</strong></p>
