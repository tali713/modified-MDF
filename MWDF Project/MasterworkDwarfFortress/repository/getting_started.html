	<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
	<p>This is a pre-installed package. Unpack and you are good to go. When you are reading this, you will already have done all the work, congrats! Please do not download a normal copy of DF and mix them, this will result in errors. All you have to do to run this mod is this:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Run Dwarf Fortress.exe.</li>
		<li>Gen a new world. </li>
		<li>Play!</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Chosing your settings</strong></p>
	<p>Masterwork DF keeps the vanilla DF feel alive. It is not a total conversion and fortress life will go on as usual. It does have many extended Industries however, which you will get to know by playing Fort-mode. If you want to alter the mod to better suit your wants, you can follow these easy steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Run Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe to add/remove parts of the mod.</li>
		<li>Chose the tileset you like, set allies and enemies to levels you like and more.</li>
		<li>Chose the active civs. <strong>You can play more than just dwarves !</strong></li>
		<li>Gen a new world using the adv. world gen with the included templates.</li>
		<li>Play.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You now have your very own version of Masterwork DF. You can even save different settings and make templates for your favourites, or ask other people for theirs! New options for succession forts await!</p>
