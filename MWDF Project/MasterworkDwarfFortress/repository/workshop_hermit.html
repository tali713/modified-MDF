	<h1>Workshops</h1>
	<p>You have access to all dwarf-civ workshops as well as a special building which starts the hermit mode; literally named &quot;!!! Start Hermit Mode!!!&quot;.</p>
	<p>To use it, build it at the beginning, it will have one reaction: Start Hermit Mode. When you run it, you will be able to select your race from 200 types and your gender. The reaction will then spawn your hermit, kill the dwarves and gives a small introduction into the story. It also spawns 7 coffins to get rid of the dwarves quickly.</p>
	<p>The workshop will get a second use now: You can pick your starting gear if you like. If not, please raze the building.</p>
	<p>For information on the normal workshops you can use, please see the dwarf-workshop section.</p>
