<div style="max-width:804px;margin:auto;">
	<p>General info:</p>
	<p>All poisonous/venomous creatures can be milked for their poison/venom.</p>
	<hr />
	<h1 align="left">Dwarven Pets</h1>
	<p align="left">You can take all vanilla DF pets with you like dogs, cats, cows, chickens, horses, etc. No changes on those.</p>
	<p align="left">Dwarves also have unique pets, which are more geared to underground fortresses than the vanilla pets. Humans still have access to those, so you can trade with them if you like. You can have access to leather, tough leather, chitin, scale and shells, as well as poisons and special milks with the new dwarven pets.</p>

	<p><em>Special: Plump Helmet Men are vicious. Enslaved by the dwarven culture, they nurture hatred and insanity against your fort. Plump Helmet Men are smart and resentful. If you let them outnumber you, they may turn the tables on your dwarves, picking fights with stragglers, covertly murdering civilians in their sleep, even causing themselves to rot with the intention of driving your dwarves insane. Can you keep these mushrooms under control, or will you succumb to the Overgrowth?</em></p>

		<h1>Plump Helmet Men</h1>
		<p><img src="screenshots/phms.png" alt="" width="755" height="63" /></p>
		<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
		<p>- PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
		<p>- A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
		<p>- Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
		<p>- Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
		<p>- Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
		<p>- PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
		<p>- Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
		<p>- Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
		<p>- Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
		<p>- PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
		<p>- Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
		<p>- Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
		<p>- Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
		<p>- Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
		<p>- The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>
