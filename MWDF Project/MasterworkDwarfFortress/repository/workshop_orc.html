		<td width="798"><h1>Core Workshops</h1>
			<p>Orcs can use most all of the workshops from vanilla Dwarf Fortress. For the most part we won't go into too much detail as there's not too much to say about these 'shops: like most races, they cook and brew, hew blocks from stone, and process cloth from plants. The Orcs can use some of the Masterwork workshops introduced in other races as well, though usually in a limited capacity.  For example, Orcs can make common alloys at the metallurgist, but they cannot produce mithril bars or other fine dwarven alloys there.</p>
			<p>Recently founded Orc clan holdings can't establish the Stonecutter, Rockforge, Tailor, Thatchery, or Sawmill, but see the entry on <a href="#Ghetto"><em>Goblin &amp; Kobold Ghetto</em></a> to see how these industries are supported in larger Orcish villages. </p>
			<p>Just as a quick note: orcs lack access to uniquely Dwarven buildings like the Gemforge and Glassforge, the Library system, the Timberyard, advanced Forges and Furnaces, the Armory and Weaponry, Runesmith, the Golem Forge. </p>
			  
			<h2>Basic Industry</h2>
				<h3 id="wargear">Tribal Wargear</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/tribal_wargear.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p>This can be a very important workshop for an early settlement, especially if elves or other dangerous ambushers are settled nearby and you need to get a strong military online fast. It lets Leather and Bone-workers create archaic but deadly weapons and decent armor without any anvil or metal. The inputs are mostly organic materials that can be supplied by hunters (or warriors...) like leather, shells, wood, ash, and bonemold. The craftsman can even infuse the weapons with blood in a dark ritual to make steel-quality weapons. Therefore, the Tribal Craftsorc should be grouped with the butchery, tannery, <a href="#boneforge">boneforge</a>, and <a href="#dtheatre">dismembering theatre</a> for best results. Forts with a strong metal industry may eventually phase out much of the work due to the complex recipes and limited selection, but some tribal craftsorcs continue to earn their keep by making masks, cloaks, or decorative armor for export.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Lamellar leather: There are several options for ways to make lamellar leather by combining leather with horn, wood, or shell, after first hardening it with tallow.
				<li>Armor: The crafter can make armor sets, robes, cloaks, and masks from lamellar leather; this is about as good a protection as one can get from leather.
				<li>Handcrafted Weapons: The basic "bonemold" quality weapons are made from lamellar, ash, bonemold bars, and fuel. Upgraded "bloodsteel" claws also require a barrel of blood but will punch through most armor. Alternative recipes use obsidian.
			</ul>
		
		<h3 id="boneforge">Boneforge</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/boneforge.png"/></p>
			<p>The boneforge is where orcs can use ancient techniques to form bonemold and bloodsteel. Bonemold is formed from a bonemeal boulder (produced by the <a href="#dtheatre">dismembering theatre</a>) and two bars of ash. It can be transmuted into the stronger bloodsteel with a barrel of blood and an additional bar of ash.</p>
			<p>Logs can be reduced to ash at the boneforge, and blood extracted from meat into barrels. Be warned that an entire stack of meat is required for a barrel of blood. Bones can also be forged into trap components directly.</p>
		
		<h3 id="fletcher">Orcish Fletcher</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/fletcher.png"/></p>
			<p>Many Orc clans rely heavily on archers to hunt, and to provide ranged support for the warbands. The fletcher keeps these archers well-supplied by creating arrows and javelins in large batches, also freeing the forges for other work.</p>
		
		<h3 id="factory">Orcish Factory</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/factory.png"/></p>
			<p>The Factory is a multi-purpose building found in most permanent Orcish settlements. It can be used to make big batches of building material, perfect for big building projects above ground. The factory also creates molds from bonemold bars and clay and uses said molds to create batches of military equipment. Ocassionally this process destroys the molds, but the mass-produced gear is made efficiently and is ideal for either quickly arming your orcs or equipping raiding parties from the <a href="#drydock">Raiders' Drydock</a>.</p>
		
		<h3 id="moltpit">Molten Pit</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/molten_pit.png"/></p>
			<p>The Molten Pit is a versatile building with a couple different uses. First, it is the Orcish mass production furnace. The efficiency is a bit low compared to the dwarven blast furnace, but a small amount of useful slag is recycled by the furnace operators here, providing a few useful materials like malachite and dolomite.</p>
			<p>The Molten Pit can also be used to reforge ill-fitting salvaged armor and weapons from pitiful small enemies. Re-forging allows you to very quickly convert small gear made from good materials into usable armor and weapons. Note, however, that the "cheap" recycled or factory pressed armors will have some gaps and misfits, so they only provide 80% coverage compared to normal armor. Be careful to use stockpiles to control which pieces the worker recycles, and be aware that if put on "repeat" he may wastefully rework the same item over and over. Simply scrapping the items will provide a chance to recycle materials from the slag, but it will always be low grade metals. If you want to melt a piece down to recover high quality material bars, you should use the normal smelter.</p>
		
		<h3 id="blacksmoke">Blacksmoke Furnace</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/blacksmoke_furnace.png"/></p>
			<p>The blacksmoke furnace is the is cornerstone of orcish heavy industry. It allows the extraction of oil from oilbearing stones, or the conversion of four bars of coke into oil. Acid can be distilled from flux, a vial, and a boulder of either brimstone, saltpeter, or rock salt. Be warned that acid is so corrosive it will render the vial unusuable after the vial of acid has been used in a reaction.
			<p>Oil and acid are used in the processing of rare minerals such as aluminum, mithril, cobalt, and titanium from non-ore boulders, alongside flux to facilitate the process.</p>
			<p>Additionally, acid and oil can be combined to form synthsilk. While not as valuable as the rare silks found in nature, it's perfectly serviceable for use in threads and cloth.</p>
			<p>All reactions at the blacksmoke furnace require fuel.</p>
		
		<h3 id="damasc">Damascene Foundry</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/damasc_forge.png"/></p>
			<p>A warlord and his chosen war-orcs might get their weapons at a Orcish Damascene Foundry, where an artisan uses ancient methods to fold exquisite blades from rare metals. The Damascene folder requires rare ores such as mithril, adamantine, cobalt, wolfram, and titanium; and tempers these alloys with steel, copper, gold, or silver. He uses powdered materials directly to create unique alloys, and cannot create standard bars for use at the forge.</p>
			
		<h3 id="ashglass">Ashland Glassblower</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/ashland_glassblower.png"/></p>
			<p>The ashclan elves live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, with outposts scattered outside the primeval forests and off the major routes of trade. Without reliable access to steeloak or mithril ore, they have developed an alternative crafts tradition of glassblowing. They make expensive "ruby stained" glass from powdered gold, and fine "cobalt stained" glass from cobaltite. With access to moonstone and malachite, or obsidian, they can make weapons-quality metallic glasses that rival the mithril gear of their silvan cousins, including the sharp, lightweight green ashland glass and heavy ebonglass.</p>
			
			
		<h3 id="ancientf">Ancient Foundry</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/ancient_foundry.png"/></p>
			<p>The steppe tribeorcs, ancestors of the modern Uruks, were nomadic warriors. They wore masterfully-made mail and wielded axe and blade in hand, all crafted from the legendary alloy, orichalcum. Orichalcum blades are sharper than the finest mithril, and armors are proof against the strongest impacts. Sadly the technique of crafting this extraordinary metal was lost when the great clan-strongholds were burned in the last age.</p>
			<p>It is said that the Dwarves once knew a mystical formula of bronze, as dense as wolfram and harder than steel. Mechanical gears made of this Deep-bronze would seem to correct their own movement as if they know the mind of their creator, and the Dwarves of this bygone age made mechanical crossbows that could fire a bolt through a keyhole at a thousand paces. It is whispered that one of the most terrible curses enacted by the mad Dwarven blood god, Armok, was to erase the secrets of Deep-bronze from the minds of the forgemasters.</p>
			<p>But deep in the mines, where even dwarves fear to tread, in the ancient catacombs of the mountainhomes, a brave orc might come across the secret to this long-forgotten knowledge.</p>
		
		<h3 id="bbowl">Blood Bowl Pitch</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/bloodbowl.png"/></p>
			<p>Orcs are passionate about any sport played with a ball on a field. The few recorded instances of peaceful interaction between Orcs and Humans involve orcish speakers trading for the rules and equipment for soccer, rugby, lacross, handball, gateball, croquet, and countless other games. Of course, when they get home, they pretty much play every sport the same way, and with very little regard for the human version of the rules. At a training pitch, Orcs can train throwing, kicking, dodging, coordination, or fighting, and will use up on average 1 piece of leather per 20 skill advances.</p>
			
		<h3 id="spit">Sparring Pit</h3>
			<p>Image unavailable</p>
			<p>When they aren't spending their time in unarmored sporting events, most orcs tend to enjoy partaking in more militant exercises, and those happen here in the sparring pit for those orcs not currently in the military proper. They can train any of their weapon, armor, or shield skills here, so long as they have the proper equipment in question. The only flaw is that ocassionally they will break their equipment while practicing, destroying on average 1 item per 20 skill advances.
			
		<h3 id="hgarden">Hermetic Gardens</h3>
			<p>Image unavailable</p>
			<p>Even the least intellectually curious Orcs can be convinced to partake in activities such as: bellowing their thoughts at random to passersby, or delivering rambling semi-dramatic soliloqies to the skulls of defeated enemy. A savvy clan leader may be able to frame these activities in a way that promotes learning. At the hermetic gardens Orcs can train a variety of mental skills, and will use up totems, cloth, and paper supplies at a rate of about 1 piece per 20 skill advances.</p>
		
		<h3 id="dtheatre">Dismembering Theatre</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/anatomical.png"/></p>
			<p>Orcish shamans typically have plenty of opportunity to practice their medical skills on live targets, but in the rare quiet moment, they can practice suturing, bonesetting, or wounddressing at the anatomical theatre. They will consume about 1 piece of thread, cloth, or splint per 20 skill advances. Many clan leaders will also send down enemy cadavers and vermin remains, and find themselves rewarded by the bounty of bonemeal their doctors produce.</p>

		<h3 id="freelance">Freelancers' Guild</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/freelancers.png"/></p>
			<p>Freelancers are Orcish adventurers who have left the Taiga clans and forged connections within the seedier elements of society in the world at large. They will buy and sell goods for cash, and unlike other markets, they are happy to perform transactions in Orcish currency — bonemold shillings. You can get shillings from them for bountiess (totems and blood), by selling them nautical equipment (grog, cloth, and ropes), or by fencing large gems, gold & silver coins. You can also buy weapons and ammo -- either for your own use, or to equip raiding parties. The Freelancers' Guild is the easiest source for pistols and firearm ammo. The "corsairs arms" consists of a pistol and knife (which are wielded together), and is a pretty good deal. Don't forget, you can always mint your own coins at the forge for 1 bar per 500.</p>
			<p>Prices subject to change, please see your local Freelancers' guild rep for current rates. Terms and conditions may apply.</p>
		
		<h3 id="drydock">Raiders' Drydock</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/raiders_drydock.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p>Dwarves may be content to lurk meekly in defense of their ivory spires and adamant halls, but Orcs prefer to sow vengeance among the home lands of their foes. From the Raiders' Drydock you can equip a longboat with weapons and enough coin for a crew of Freelancers to depart on a expedition of your choosing. The crew are likely to perish forgotten and alone in a distant land; but there is a chance they may return instead with an assortment of plundered metals, powerful weapons, or even rare blueprints & artifacts for the clan Artisians and Dreamwalkers to study. Drydocks must be constructed outside, and you are encouraged to build them adjacent to a body of water for maximum thematic effect.</p>
			<p>A raiding crew needs three items for their journey: A raiding boat, a bundle of weapons, and a number (usually 5000) of bonemold coins for expenses. The boat is normally a longboat, constructed at the drydock from 10 wood logs and 3 ballista parts. Some clan leaders will try to save wood by using xebec ships instead, even though these require cloth and ropes; even more conservationist leaders will opt for a junk ship, using a metal cannon in place of the traditional ballista. The weapons bundle is made from any 5 weapons; even daggers or cheap factory produced gear will be fine. There is a 50% chance that the boat and the weapons bundle survive the journey. Coins can be obtained at the Freelancer's Guild or minted at the forge, and the Raiders will spend this money no matter what. If successful, the raid will produce a loot crate with can be opened at the drydock.</p>
			<p>The loot you can get is random, and depends very much on the target! For example, elves may yield wood and saplings, elven weapons, enchanted arrows or raw mithril. A raid on dwarves might yield precious metals, weapons, and rare weapon-grade alloys.</p>
		
		<h3 id="caravan">The Caravanserai</h3>
			<div class="adjacent_images"> <img src="screenshots/common_bazaar.png"/> <img src="screenshots/arms_bazaar.png"/> <img src="screenshots/farmers_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/shadowbroker.png"/></div>
			<p>The Caravanserai are a set of 4 bazaars that buy and sell goods for coin. It is common to loot caravanserai blueprints when Raiding Merchant Shipping, or you can buy additional blueprints from the Shadowbroker bazaar. These traders can help you profit while decluttering your Fort by buying all sorts of goods such as food, cloth, leather, and weapons from your base in exchange for cold, hard cash. You can turn around and buy stuff with the coins, or even with coins you mint. The bazaars mostly deal in the traditional currency of copper, silver, and gold coins; which can be broken into bonemold shillings at the Freelancer's Guild. All bazaars host moneychangers who will exchange the various coinages taken there.</p>
			<p>The Common Bazaar will buy cloth and leather, and sells anvils, metals, and coal. Additionally, an envoy from the bazaar can be dispatched to encourage migrants or a caravan to come to your site.</p>
			<p>The Farmers' Bazaar will purchase food and drink from you, and will provide wood, wicker, potash, gypsum and seed packets for aspiring farmers. You can buy surface, cave, and boreal seeds which are collected by master gardeners for use in certain biomes. 
			<p>The Arms Bazaar will let you sell excess armor and weapons, although the price is a low, fixed rate, so you may want to dispose of more valuable equipment in other ways. They will also sell arrows, trap components, and steel-grade weaponry not common amongst orcs like crossbows and warhamers.</p>
			<p>A few high-end transactions are forbidden by the international Caravanserai charter, and these must only be conducted in platinum currency available at the Shadowbroker. In particular, the Shadowbroker facilitates immigration of goblins & kobolds and the ransom of captives from hostile civilizations.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Ghetto">Goblin &amp; Kobold Ghetto</h2>
			<p>Goblin and Kobold workers are normally picked up by your Raiders, if you send them on a special trip to a village in the hinterlands. These voyages are much higher probability of success than raids into hostile territories, but still requires a boat, weapon kit, and some shillings. You can also sometimes rescue a gob or kob ship's mate from a Merchant raid, or you can always just fork over cash to the Shadowbroker to smuggle workers in. Until deployed into their workshop, Goblin workers will be stored along with other useful items in your Tools stockpile.</p>
			
		<h3 id="gtinker">Tinkerers' Shanty</h3>	
			<p>The Tinkerer's Shanty houses a goblin who can craft advanced flachette guns, pistols, and muskets, and who has the skill to duplicate trap components. He can also hand-load rounds for guns, making his own black powder from scratch without help of a chemist. Since the tinkerer uses so much brass and lead, he has his own small low-temperature furnace to help with smelting a few basic ores.</p>
		
		<h3 id="gsawmill">Sawmill Sweatshop</h3>
			<p>The Sawmill Shanty houses a goblin woodworker and his shop. The goblin woodworker is excellent at stretching limited resources; he can cut 20 planks from 5 logs. He can even make big batches of 10 bins, barrels, chairs, or cabinets from 5 logs, as long as he has access to some metal for fasteners.</p>
			
		<h3 id="gstonecut">Stonecutters' Shanty</h3>
			<p>The Stonecutter's Shanty houses a goblin masonry apprentice and his workshop. He takes on tasks which are beneath the notice of Orcish masons, like grinding excess stone, sorting the magma-safe rocks from others, crafting rock weapons and traps, cutting blocks back apart into stone, and mass-producing rock furniture. He can also make rock bins and barrels, although be warned that they can be pretty heavy.</p>
		
		<h3 id="gthief">Thieves' Shanty</h3>
			<p>The Thieves' Shanty can equip goblin thieves with a dagger and bag, and send them out into the world with a chance to steal some precious metals and gems for the clan, or can equip a headhunter with a cage as well. He can also forge batches of darts, useful if the Goblin Tinkerer is providing the troops with flachette guns. Flachette guns have a good rate of fire and so dart batches can be effective for training up a gun warband if metal guns & ammo are in low supply. They also make fine trap components, perhaps in combination with poisoned darts.</p>
			
		<h3 id="ktextile">Textile Sweatshop</h3>
			<p>The Kobold Textile Sweatshop can mass-produce sets of clothing from cloth, wool, or silk; and can process grasses to wicker. Wicker bins are valued for their light weight in any fort, and other wicker furniture can be in great demand in overland camps. He can also practice a few tribal weavers' tricks such as weaving rope from rope-reed.</p>
			
		<h3 id="kmuck">Muckrackers' Shanty</h3>
			<p>The Muckrackers' Shanty specializes in making batches of clay items for those camps that have access to clay, but they can also compress peat soil into usable fuel for your furnaces, and the workers here can create special glazes from lead, copper, iron, and tin to use on their pottery.</p>

		<h3 id="kpoison">Poisoners' Shanty</h3>
			<p>The Poisoners' Shanty houses a kobold who creates poisons that can be applied to to ammo, weapons, and trap components at the Poison Vat. Besides using a number of poison recipes stolen from the Free Peoples, the kobolds here have developed an improved blight poison and a special batch of pinkskin bane, for use against humans, dwarves, and elves. All reactions here require a bit of cobalt dust, but otherwise each potion has its own unique recipe.</p>
		
		<h3 id="kbone">Bonescrimmers' Shanty</h3>
			<p>The Bonescrimmers' Shanty can mass produce furniture made of bone, for those camps that have a particular excess of the material.</p>
		
		<h3 id="labor">Labor Cells</h3>
			<p><img src="screenshots/laborcells.png"/></p>
			<p>The Labor Cells are a special case. Sometimes your Raiders will take captive a Dwarf, Elf, or Human. Large clanholdings generally pass these captives quickly through contacts at the Caravanserai's Shadowbroker for a significant ransom. However, camps which are short on simple materials such as ore, coal, wood, or basic crafts can choose to deploy these guests as laborers, although their work presents a significant drain on food resources.</p>
