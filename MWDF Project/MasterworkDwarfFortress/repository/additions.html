	<p>Raw Additions are literally that. Additional content in Raw format, the way DF reads out text files. The objects modders can add are mostly creatures, entities, inorganics, interactions, items, grasses, plants and workshop/reactions. The last one will be explained in great detail for every single workshop, so I wont mention them here.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="creatures.html">Creatures</a> are animals and monsters, which can be  pets or wildlife.</li>
          <li><a href="entities.html">Entities</a> are civilizations, this adds new allies or enemies.</li>
          <li><a href="inorganics.html">Inorganics</a> are rocks, minerals, gems, metals, soils and ores.</li>
          <li><a href="grasses.html">Grasses</a> are rarely used, but change the look greatly.</li>
          <li><a href="plants.html">Plants</a> include both plants and trees, and have a big impact on the game balance.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>In the navigation menu you can find a link to each of these categories. I will give as much information as feasable, but just know that MDF adds a ludacris large amount of Raws. It would make no sense to add every detail, because it would take days to read.</p>
