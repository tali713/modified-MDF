	<h1>General Info</h1>
	<p><strong>Skills:</strong> All skills are the same as vanilla DF. There is nothing new to learn here.</p>
	<p><strong>Combat: </strong>Nothing has changed. If you want melee, ranged or traps, thats still your choice to make.</p>
	<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> In addition to all vanilla weapons, you can also make powerful great-weapon, only wielded with two hands. A javelin thrower makes a better crossbow, and there are a few more weapons like pikes and halberds available now.</p>
	<p>All weapons can be improved in the weaponry.</p>
	<p><strong>Ammo:</strong> Besides vanilla ammo, you can now make broadhead, hammerhead and piercing ammo. These work like slashing damage, blunt damage and piercing damage.</p>
	<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Besides vanilla armor, you have access to plate armor, which is slightly better but costs you more bars.</p>
	<p><strong>Materials:</strong> In addition to vanilla materials you have access to tanned skins like upgrade scale, chitin and shell, higher metals like titanium, wolfram, cobalt, higher alloys like mithril or volcanic. The best is still the delicious blue candy deep underground.</p>
	<p><strong>Pets:</strong> All vanilla pets are still there. In addition you got some more dwarfy alternatives: Shaggy badgerdogs, rock-crabs, leatherwing-bats that can be shorn for leather, bearded cavernkeets, birds that have shearable beards and more... </p>
	<p><strong>Food:</strong> No changes here.</p>
	<p><strong>Drink:</strong> Alcohol is just as important as ever.</p>
	<p><strong>Digging:</strong> Mining has not  changed much. But some shallow rock types and rubble patches only leave dust when mined, which forces you to dig deeper for real rock. Fossils, relics and treasure can be dug up from ruins, your archeologist can identify and restore them. You can also stumble upon the Gems of Armok, which have special effects tied to them, like water/magma generation.</p>
	<p><strong>Embark:</strong> Your embark selection is pretty much the same as in vanilla. You don't necessarily need an anvil, because you can make them from ore in the smelter, but otherwise everything is the same. Some more pets, some more metals, but nothing that stands out.</p>
	<p><strong>Nobles:</strong> All vanilla nobles are still there. </p>
	<p><strong>Magic: </strong>No real magic for the dwarves, but they can cover their weapons with runes for a slight buff.</p>
	<p><strong>Tech:</strong> Most dwarven tech is centered around metalworking and forging, so it would be best to focus on mining and getting access to magma. This will help seeing their best side. :)</p>
	<p><strong>Castes: </strong>Guilds and Military groups. These learn their fitting skills at a 200% rate, the military group members are also a bit more sturdy in combat. You can join guilds/groups in the guildhouse or garrison workshops for 2500 gold coins.</p>
	<p><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Besides 'Temperature: On', I honestly cant think of anything that needs to play. Only the metallurgist comes to mind, because all alloy-making reactions have been moved there. Otherwise all vanilla DF rules apply, but there is nothing that MasterworkDF forces you to do to survive. </p>
	<p>Just keep in mind that vanilla DF has <strong>one</strong> invader race, Goblins. MasterworkDF has <strong>sixteen</strong>. This means up a lot more !FUN!,snatcher, thieves, sieges and ambushes. Again, these are optional. You can even add another <strong>fifteen </strong>fortress defence races to it.</p>
