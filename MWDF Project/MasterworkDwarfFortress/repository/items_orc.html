	<h1><a name="forge" id="forge"><font size="5">Forged Weapons</font></a></h1>
	<p><b>Forge:</b> There are lots of ways to get weapons in Orc Fortress, but having a good smith work a forge will never be obsolete. The standard selection of weapons is somewhat different than in a Dwarven settlement. These same weapon types can be made at the Factory too, in efficient batch production but with less materials options.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Scimitar:</em> The standard orcish sword and a fine slashing weapon, larger than a dwarvish short sword but still wieldable in one hand by any orc. </li>
		<li><em>Large Dagger:</em> An inferior blade, but can occassionally inflict deadly deep stab wounds. A common choice to issue to Raiding crews since it takes a minimum amount of metal to craft.</li>
		<li><em>Club:</em> An orcish blunt weapon; with its large contact surface it is a crude weapon compared to Dwarven hammers, but still serviceable in the hands of a strong orc.</li>
		<li><em>Jagged Axe:</em> This axe lacks the critical strikes of the Dwarven battleaxe, but has extra contact area. Strong or skilled Orcish Axeman may prefer the reliable stopping and hewing power against any humanoid sized targets.</li>
		<li><em>Toothed Spear:</em> A good all-around weapon, wielders will alternate piercing impaling blows with raking slashes; and even smaller orcs can effectly pair it with a shield. </li>
		<li><em>Bladed Chains:</em> A two-handed flail weapon, which inflicts painful piercing damage. Great for disabling foes, not the best for finishing them off quickly. </li>
		<li><em>Great-weapons:</em> Orcs can produce the Great Axe and Maul, identical to the dwarven versions, but many Uruks are large enough to wield these weapons one-handed!</li>
		<li><em>Katana</em>: The katana is a medium-sized slashing sword with small contact area, like a shortsword, but with deeper strike penetration depth. The patternwelded mithril version crafted by the Damascene folder should slice almost any armor.</li>
		<li><em>Polehammer</em>: This unique weapon is a blunt weapon wielded with the spear skill. Sometimes it will strike with a frightening amount of force due to a small contact area and leverage from a long haft. The patternwelded wolfram version crafted by the damascene folder is as deadly as any dwarven hammer, although it requires two hands for almost all users. </li>

	</ul>
	<h1><font size="5"><a name="ranged" id="ranged">Ranged Weapons</a></font></h1>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Bowyer:</b> Here you can make the entry-level Orcish &quot;Recurve Bow,&quot; which is a fine weapon. The Bowyer can also make wood or bone tomahawks, which are very poor melee weapons, but they would at least allow you to quickly start equipping throwing tomahawks. A tomahawk squad which will ever see action in a close melee should switch to forged or damascene metal tomahawks as soon as possible. </li>
		<li><b>Orcish Fletcher:</b> Many Orc clans rely heavily on archers to hunt, and to provide ranged support for the warbands. The Fletcher makes &quot;Composite bows,&quot; requiring lamellar leather as well as wood, or bone or iron. These bows are twice as powerful as the orcish recurve bow, that is, four times the primitive Dwarvish bow, so it is worth upgrading when possible. The fletcher can also make batches of arrows from lots of common materials, freeing up your forges for other work. With access to Elven toolkits, the Fletcher can even make devastating enchanted arrows. </li>
		<li><em>Guns</em>: Smaller Orcish settlements, if they need firearms, typically turn to the local Freelancer&#39;s Guild for a few pistols, although the price that pirates charge for ammo adds up quickly. Alternatively, a Goblin Tinkerer&#39;s Shanty can produce a mechanical dart-throwing Flachette gun that serves nearly as well. The Tinkerer may work closely with the Kobolds too, who can create vast quantities of darts and poison. Larger camps with access to proper raw materials such as potash, gypsum, brass, and lead may choose to establish proper pistol and ammo production domestically. With access to Human toolkits, the Tinkerer can make muskets too.</li>
		<li><em>Tomahawk:</em> A small axe, which can be wielded in combination with throwing tomahawks (ammo) and a shield. Popular with orc frontier patrols in small garrisons that lack a dedicated archery squad. </li>
		<li><em>Ammo:</em> The basic orcish ammo are Arrows (for bows), Throwing Tomahawks (for tomahawks), and Darts (for blowguns and flachette guns). Note that jagged arrows have a much larger edge than common arrows, inflicting grevious wounds but at some cost of penetration ability. Orcs do not commonly use crossbows, though they ocassionally do arm themselves with such.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> <a name="uncommon" id="uncommon"><font size="5">Crafts</font></a><font size="5"><a name="uncommon" id="uncommon"> Weapons</a></font> </p>
	<p>The Tribal Warcrafter deals in Bonemold and Bloodsteel, weapons made directly from bonemold, ash, lamellar leather, and blood. He can also make a few items from rock and obsidian.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Macuahuitl</em>: This tribal weapon deals some longsword-like slashes and some shallow but very long raking cuts, can be devastating to lightly armored opponents. </li>
		<li><em>War Claws</em>: Savage daggers fixed to the warrior&#39;s fists, these weapons deal piercing damage that can penetrate armor, and incapacitate the enemy with pain. </li>
		<li><em>Bola throwers and ammo:</em> The bola is an incapacitating thrown weapon preferred by some Orcish hunters. </li>
		<li><em>Jagged spears</em></li>
	</ul>
	<p><font size="5"><a name="society" id="society">Warrior Society</a><a name="uncommon" id="uncommon"> Weapons</a></font></p>
	<p>Warrior Society Weapons represent dual-wield loadouts, and act either as particularly powerful melee weapons, or as good melee weapons with a strong ranged attack. The material of the PRIMARY weapon determines the material of the Society kit. If you need extra SECONDARY weapons to complete your kits, the material isn&#39;t critical, so consider buying them from the Caravanserai or Freelancers guild.</p>
