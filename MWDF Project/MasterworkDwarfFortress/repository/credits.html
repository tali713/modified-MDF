        <p align="left"><em>The great DF forum modding community allowed me the use   most of their raws to learn, find more ideas, or even whole parts of their mod.   Without it this mod would not be possible.</em> </p>
        <p align="left"><em>I want to thank hugo_the_dwarf, rephikul, deon,   phoebus, narhiril, veok, bdog, quietust, warlord255, it 000, funk,   darkflagrance, d_e, zero, Ashnal, LucasNP, teh zip file, admiralawesome,   Seth_Creid, Naryar, Xangi, arclance, cc, san diego, UristDavinci and many many more. The   support in the forum was and is great. :)</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>I also got a lot of feedback in the mod thread,   and even there the users helped by reporting inbalanced features, bugs and more.   Sometimes I came back to the forum, and found the correct fix already posted.   Thanks guys, you are awesome :)</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>Special thanks again to hugo_the_dwarf   and rephikul  for the getting me started and deon, for the genesis mod, which started my interest in modding. Zenerbufen for his Mac and Linux Support, Godlysockpuppet for his help on this manual, and Roses for the Sourcecode of the Python GUI, as well as Arclance for his continued labors on linux and python.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>Roses for his python scripts, and Maklak for his perl scripts, both of which have helped greatly with writing the manual and finding oddities in the raws.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>All the authors of third-party utlities who allowed me to include them in my pack, especially Splinterz, who often coded towards my needs, and quickly at that.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>Smakemupagus also deserves a special mention, for his integrated Orc Fortress plugin. Talvieno, for his random creature generation script, and the entire dfhack team for their amazing plugins that open new possibilities in modding. </em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>New additions to these credits are: Ag, Falconne, Warmist, Expwnent, Kurik Amudnil, Boltgun, Putnam, Vjek, Urist DaVinci and Peterix. All of which have helped with scriptes, either by coding themselves, fixing or helping on them. Many advanced features wouldnt be possible without dfhack. Insolor for his localization patcher, which allowed nice little eastereggs and new skills/labors.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>Everyone who worked on the wiki, especially Briess/Lokriani and Smake for getting it started, and Jimboo for proof-reading so much of my texts. Apani, for the Pottery Overhaul. Toady One, for the dedicated Masterwork Child-Board. To the DFFD, which hosted over 50GB traffic for Masterwork by now.</em> (A number I can only laugh about now, 2014, two years later. Current traffic is around 1TB per month.)</p>
        <p align="left"><em>Thank you for the support and greetings out to everyone playing the mod, recording LetsPlays, managing SuccessionForts, doing FanArt or Story-Writing... thanks for spreading the word.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>And, of course, THANK YOU!!! to every person who donated real life money for a completely free game.</em> Close to 2000$ have been donated in total.</p>
        <p align="left"><em>Dwarf and Orc in the Logo by Eva   Zimmermann.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>Original Dwarf Fortress by Tarn Adams.</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>Modification by Meph. </em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>PS: Wow. The credits are getting longer and longer... :-)</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>PPS: And more: Halfling for his disease-mod, IndigoFenix for the Plump Helmet Men, BillyJack for his continued improvements on stockpiling and minor bugs, Urist McTeellox for his github patching, and Thistleknot for the work on spreadsheets for the DT. Jodgap and Splinterz again for their work on a custom DT. :)</em></p>
        <p align="left">PPPS: Now, another 2 years later, I should probably start updating this page. :D</p></td>
