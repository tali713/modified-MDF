<h1>Succubus materials</h1>
<h2>Available metals</h2>
<p>The succubi unfortunatly did not develop metallurgy as well as other races and are outclassed by dwarves. You will be unable to make steel or even clean the rusty variant. It is a good idea to sort the spoils from sieges and melt down steel and mithril items you will find, with perhaps the exception of breastplates that you can wear on top of corsets.</p>
<h2>Stygian bronze</h2>
<p>Stygian Bronze is made at the smelter using bronze and flux stone. I addition of yielding even more metal per reaction (2 bars for 1 unit of bronze), stygian bronze in unnaturaly lightweight. This metal is good for armor, providing protection without hurting speed and is okay for cutting weapons. It is bad for blunt attacks and non bladed whips.</p>
<p>If you are running short of flux stone, you can grind bone into bonemeal at the Bonemill as a replacement.</p>
<h2>Basiliskine</h2>
<p>Basiliskine is, like stygian bronze, a lightweight metal suited for cutting weapons and armors. It's resistance is at the same level as steel, making it your best choice of protection without sacrifying mobility.</p>
<p>It is obtained by shearing lesser basilisk (or their larger cousins) to obtain an horn that can be treated at the smelter. Lesser basilisks can be obtained at the Summoning Circle using a bar of lead and a flux material.</p>
<h2>Leather</h2>
<p>Having leather or their equivalents will allow you to further protect your succubi. Leather armor can be worn over corsets and chain mail can be replaces by bodysuits.</p>
<h2>Mining hazards</h2>
<p>Warpstone, usually fatal to those who mine it, is benefitial to Succubi. Your miners get positive effects from mining both weak and unstable warpstone. Antracite however remain hazardous to mine, unless you capture and convert dwarves. Devils are immune to black lung.</p>
<h2>Glass mass production</h2>
<p>After discovering magma, or spawning some at the magma well, you will unlock the floating glass furnace. This workshop will take raw glass to produce blocks and windows in great quantities.</p>
