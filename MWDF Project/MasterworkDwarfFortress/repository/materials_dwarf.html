<h1>Materials</h1>
	<p>Dwarves have access to several new metals and leathers that are pretty unique. Master metalsmiths and forgers, they can work adamantine and make clothing from gold, silver or mithril strands.</p>
    <p>Volcanic is made in the volcanic foundry. Its better than steel , but is very expensive and requires magma.</p>
    <p>Tungsten  is a new weapon/armor material that is heavy, but excellent for blunt weapons.</p>
    <p>Cobalt is an alternative to iron.</p>
    <p>Titanium is a lightweight and valuable decorational material, but very brittle.</p>
    <p>Orichalcum is extracted slowly, 1% from each ore, but makes for excellent weapons and armor, or for rare magical reactions. Use it wisely. Artefacts from it are prized possessions.</p>
    <p>The tanner can tan chitin, shell and scales; improve them to chitinplate, shellplate and scaleplate, which are about iron-grade. You can also harden leather, which is twice as strong as normal leather.</p>
