            <td width="798"><h1>The Taiga Orcs</h1>
				<p>For many years, the dominion of the Orcs was complete, and none of the so-called &quot;civilizations&quot; would dare violate the eternal hunting grounds. Our fathers' fathers culled the elves in primeval forests as a jaguar stalks its prey. Mighty Uruk warriors blazed trails at will through steppe and villages alike with axe and fire. Only Dwarf-kind managed any opposition to our rule, and even an assault from the lowest of our goblin cousins would drive them cowering behind the walls of their Fortress homes.</p>
				<p>But ours is not that era. Ours is the time of Masterwork Dwarf Fortress, where the Dwarves and Elves have mastered elite arts of metallurgy and warcraft. Even the hapless humans have learned to defend themselves, in their awkward way, with their lumbering suits of steel and random blasts of musketry. Orcs have been driven from their traditional homelands into bleak, marginal reservations in the cold and dark taiga.</p>
				<p>Trapped between the mithril spears of the elves and the cruel frozen seas, the Orcs know that they must adopt civilization and industry or else perish. Orcish survivors have banded together, bitterly calling themselves the &quot;Taiga Clans&quot; and swearing revenge. You are now called upon to reclaim our lands, to stake out resources. Our numbers are too few, so you will travel not with a horde at your back. You will have a crew of just 7 orcs; if you are particularly lucky you may have one decent warrior or smith in the bunch. More likely, your crew will be a sorry lot of peasants, shaman, and snaga. You will be under constant assault by the Dwarves, Humans, and Drow, and if you are unlucky mithril-armed Elves may ambush as early as spring of Year 2! The so-called &quot;Fortress Defense&quot; civilizations refuse our emissaries as well and can be counted as enemies.</p>
				<p>The first order of business is survival. The various clans have brought efficient recipies for leatherworking, dark rituals for crafting tribal bloodsteel weapons, and traditions of bowyery and fletching that served for centuries in great hunts of elves. We may too find allies in these lands: Our goblin cousins will happily trade what pitiful wares that they can, and you might chose to settle near outcast criminal bands of Humans, Dwarves, Drow, or even Elves who would make fine trade partners.</p>
				<p>But your ambition is greater. You still remember the burnt husk of the Factory of the Black Citadel, whose furnaces once consumed the entire great midland forests, and are sure that your minions could recreate it if given enough resources. You still have your pirate contacts from the Freelancer's Guild, and you know that for a few coins these corsairs can acquire enough weapons to arm a mercenary army. Perhaps these rogues could even steal some technology from your enemies -- What damage could a proper Orc commander inflict with a regiment of rifles; with dwarven mail; with elven bows and drowish magicks? From the deep-orcs of the mountains, you have claimed the lost secrets of metal-folding, and you foresee a day when your Uruks wield razor sharp damascene blades instead of crude choppas. No matter what tools you choose, you know that victory is in your grasp. For the clans! For vengeance! To WAAAAAAAAGH!</p>
				<h2>Orcs and Castes</h2>
				<p>There are three main castes in Taiga Orc civilization. The standard <strong>Orc</strong> caste are most similar to their feral Orcish brethren, and the baseline to which other Orcs are compared. They are very strong, and quite agile, and are about a bit larger than humans. They learn leatherworking and bonecarving readily, and take quickly to dodging, wrestling, and melee combat. However, orcs learn brewing, gemwork, mining and stone-detailing more slowly than dwarves. A hard life in a hard land has endowed the Taiga Orcs with fine intuition and patience, but Orcs are lacking in other mental attributes and are mediocre students.</p>
				<p>About 1 in 8 Taiga orcs are born into the <strong>Uruk</strong> caste, descended from the mighty nomadic tribes of the steppes. They have legendary strength, toughness, and recuperation. Since they are about 10% again larger than their clansmates, Uruks can wield vicious great-axes and longswords to deadly effect, generally even one handed. Finally, they are the only Orc to enter a Martial Trance, making them the core of any horde which hopes to face worthy enemies in melee.</p>
				<p>About 2 in 8 Taiga orcs are born into the <strong>&quot;Snaga&quot;</strong> caste, rumored to have mixed Goblin blood in their ancestry. They are small and weak, like a goblin, but some have grudgingly earned respect as archers in Taiga warbands due to their remarkable agility. Of course, more traditionally minded warchiefs assign the honor of such victories to the clan's master fletcher, considering the snaga themselves to be little more than disposable tools.</p>
				<p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <strong>&quot;Artisans&quot;</strong>, rare creative minds who make good bone-, leather-or wood-crafts orcs. Although Orcish smiths are best known for the terrible spectacle of their crude factories and slag pits, Taiga-clan artisans also remember some of the secret arts of metal folding and fletchery passed down from their clanfathers.</p>
				<p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <strong>&quot;Dreamwalkers&quot;</strong>, weird frail creatures who are nevertheless feared and honored for their mental prowess. Dreamwalkers are adept priests and doctors, and they can often read and write -- even using numbers on occasion. Female Dreamwalkers are revered among the dwindling tribes for they often have litters of multiple young. When called upon to join the warbands, Dreamwalkers seek out special arcane weapons which channel dark aspects of their wild magics, while a few undertake spirit journeys in the hope of becoming powerful Sorcerers or Druids.</p>
				<p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <strong>&quot;Corsairs&quot;</strong>, Orcs taken with a passion for buccaneering and adventure. Renowned for their skill with fire-arms and ballistae, the Corsairs true value to the clans is an uncanny ability to accurately assess the value of trade and plunder.</p>
				<p>About 2% of Taiga orcs are <strong>&quot;Ronin&quot;</strong>, casteless uruk who hope to barter their skill in arms for a place with honor in a new clan. In the frontier settlements, ronin are greatly sought after as sergeants, trainers, and even warchiefs. Male ronin train primarily with the sword, while female ronin traditionally prefer the bow.</p>
				<p>About 2% of Taiga orcs are <strong>&quot;Ologs&quot;</strong>, enormous hulks that even tower over the Uruk, and it is rumoured they have the blood of trolls in their ancestory. Slow to learn most skills, Ologs are extremely deadly with blunt weapons, which they wield with staggering force. Ologs show a natural affinity for stone and gems, and quickly grasp the concepts of how to set and carve them, even when other mental feats escape them.                        </p>
				<h2>Orcish Honour and Rituals</h2>
				<p>Taiga Orcs have a strong sense of clan honour, and <em>true</em> honour is only earned in combat against powerful foes. Orcs can and will butcher their enemies, and while the meat can provide a feast in victory celebrations, Taiga Orcs will collect the scalps of their greatest foes to display the honour of their clan. The scalps of humans, dwarves, elves, and drow are particularly prized.</p>
				<p>Scalps will be automatically preserved at the tannery, and have multiple uses in your camp. Ten preserved scalps and a bolt of cloth can be sewn into a <em>standard of honour</em>. No clan of Taiga Orcs will fail to display their honour in the <em>Caravanserai</em> so guests of the clan can see that the clan is worth its salt. Particularly honoured foes will have their scalps hung in the <em>Warrior's Meadhall</em>, where they will be able to listen to the warriors tell the stories of their last battle and may receive offerings of mead, which they may reward by granting the warrior a portion of their strength and skill.</p>
				<p>A great clan may write one or more <em>codexes</em>, either on the art of battle or the art of magic. The construction of a codex is a great ritual and honour, and incoprorates the scalps of great enemies into the covers, so the spirits of the clan's enemies may guard the secrets contained within. Scalps are also used in the initation of great warriors into socieities, and in the construction of fearsome battle masks.</p>
				<p>While Taiga Orc warriors value the scalps of their great enemies, the clan Dreamwalkers deal directly with the souls of their fallen foes. Dreamwalkers aid the souls on their journey to the fields of the fallen, where they fight and drink for all eternity with other worthy warriors. As part of this ritual, the Dreamwalker weaves a talisman. These talismans are central in the Dreamwalkers' rituals as they are a sign of a Dreamwalker's honour. Dreamwalkers then use these in their dealings with the spirits to prove that they are worthy of the spirit's attention. It is said they also allow them to explore the dreams and memories of the soul that was guided and there have been rumours of dreamwalkers who have been able to design powerful workshops and libraries which they have only seen in their dreams.</p>
				<h2>Taiga-orc Society and Nobles</h2>
				<p>Taiga Orcs have nobles, but organized a bit differently than the Dwarves.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The <strong>&quot;clan leader&quot;</strong> oversees the day to day affairs of an orcish expedition, receiving diplomats and meeting with workers. The clan leader is expected to stay on the job in larger settlements even after other greater nobles arrive.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The <strong>&quot;warchief&quot;</strong> is the leader of a clan's military forces.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>One or more <strong>&quot;scribes&quot;</strong> can be appointed, and each takes on the responsibilities of both Accounting and Production 	management.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>One or more <strong>&quot;shaman&quot;</strong> can be appointed. Shaman are required for medical diagnoses, and also can help calm angry orcs.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The orc designated <strong>&quot;speaker&quot;</strong> takes responsibility for trade.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>An <strong>&quot;executioner&quot;</strong>, if appointed, is the sole embodiment of the rule of law in any clan-holding without a huscarl.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When a clan grows to the notice of the central confederation, a <strong>&quot;Thain&quot;</strong> is appointed to ensure the clan's survival. The Thain is a hereditary position and may be promoted to Hersir or Jarl as the clan continues to grow. As Jarls rise through the ranks they may chose to appoint clan champions including the Huscarl, Battlemage, and Avenger.</p>
