		<h1><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Vanilla Tips and Tricks</a></h1>
		<p>All these tricks are collected from the forum and are for vanilla DF. They also work in the mod, but there are no mod specific entries here.</p>
		<p><strong>1. Mass Dumping</strong></p>
		<p>By pressing d-b-d you can select every item on the screen for dumping. In the same menu you will find the shortcuts for Unumping (d-b-D), Forbidding (d-b-f) and Reclaiming (d-b-c) </p>
		<p><strong>2. Quantum Stockpiles</strong></p>
		<p>In stockpile, every item requires one square. By making an open-space square and marking it as a garbage dump, you can throw unlimited items into it. Everything will staple in a place one Z-level below. Just dig an access tunnel and unforbid the items to use them. Note that no actual stockpiles are necessary.</p>
		<p><strong>3. Atom smashing</strong></p>
		<p>Items under a closing drawbridge will be removed from the game. An atom-smashing device would use a Quantum Stockpile and a raised drawbrigde that closes upon the Quantum stockpile, destroying everything inside. Used to remove clutter and help FPS. Can also be used as an exploit (?) to kill creatures. Creatures of immense size will instead destroy the bridge, when lowered.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Watchtowers</strong></p>
		<p>Ambusher will move invisible over the map, till they encounter a living being. By placing pets on chains on chokepoints you can detect them safely.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Building destroyer traps</strong></p>
		<p>A creature with the building destroyer will path to the nearest building. Building a little maze with a statue inside, protected by cage/weapon-traps will neutralize the threat. Works most awesomely with a Support holding a 3x3 floor one Z-level above. Support gets destroyed and the 3x3 square will fall down, killing everything with a cave-in.</p>
		<p><strong>6. Trapping trap-avoid creatures</strong></p>
		<p>It is possible to trap creatures that avoid traps by placing a web over the trap. Getting a gaint-cave-spider to shoot at your traps does somehow require some preperation. Easier when done with tamed spiders. Cave-In dust will also push creatures into traps. The stun-effect will disable the trapavoid.</p>
		<p><strong>7. Saving dwarves that are outside during invasion</strong></p>
		<p>Build small rooms in the countryside, 3x3, with a floorhatch and some food/drinks inside. When a force of darkness arrives, send your dwarves into those by adding them to burrows you made in these bunkers. Afterwards lock the floorhatch. Miner can rescue themselves, by digging a 1x1 channel, and then again a 1x1 channel in the same square. No direct pathing and no direct line of sight will keep the invaders away. Afterwards dig exit stairs.</p>
		<p><strong>8. Wells can be built with many Z-levels between them and water.</strong></p>
		<p>A 50 Z-level drop to a cavern lake is absolutely possible. But note that the bucket has a longer way to travel, making them less effective.</p>
		<p><strong>9. Water can be drained by engraving fortifactions on the map edge.</strong></p>
		<p>All water will now flow through and off the map.</p>
		<p><strong>10. Picks use the mining skill even in combat.</strong></p>
		<p>Assign legendary miners into your army, or draft them as a back up militia. Enables fast training for your soldiers as well, just designate a huge area for digging, enable mining labor and give all your soldiers picks. Legendary weapon skill in no time.</p>
		<p><strong> 11.Ballistas are very inaccurate.</strong></p>
		<p>By building a 3-tile wide corridor and a 5-tile wide room in the end you can build 3 ballistas that cover one corridor. Build the first ballista to the left, the second behind it one tile to the right, the third behind it another tile to the right.</p>
		<p><strong>12. Dwarves build walls from the wrong side.</strong></p>
		<p>Default is to build from the left or top to build a construction. To avoid getting your dwarves stuck just build a wall in the square you want your dwarves to avoid, and suspend it before it is finished. Then finish the construction you wanted, and cancel the suspended wall. Dwarves will always choose to stand on a normal square then a square designated to be used in any way.</p>
		<p><strong>13. Designation selection</strong></p>
		<p>When you designate, for example, every tree to be cut the woodcutters will start top-left, no matter how far away this is. To avoid long distances for your workers and haulers designate a smaller block nearby, afterwards expand slowly. That is also safer, since your dwarves will no longer be scattered all over the map.</p>
		<p><strong>14. Cavern avoidance</strong></p>
		<p>If you want to avoid caverns and get straight to the magma, dig your stairs in a straight line in one of the corners of the map. That reduces the chance to hit a cavern significantly. You can also start building a farmplot, but before you press enter just take the farmplot and scroll down. The X that indicate if floor is soil or rock will turn green once they are above cavern soil. This is an exploit that has been named &quot;dwarven radar&quot; and can be found in the bay12forum, in case you want more info and screenshots.</p>
		<p><strong>15. Designation over multiple Z-levels</strong></p>
		<p>By using your mouse to do a designation, holding the mouse button down and then scrolling Z-levels you will apply the designation in every Z-level. Helps a lof for building long Up-down-staircases and pumpstacks.</p>
		<p><strong>16. Free marksman equipment</strong></p>
		<p>If the ambusher skill is the highest skill a dwarf has at embark, he will embark with a leather armor, a crossbow and 25 random material bolts. Just disable the hunter labor and you have a fully geared back-up marksdwarf from the very start.</p>
		<p><strong> 17. Make your woodcutter your animal trainer.</strong>
		<p>Woodcutters are the most exposed and endangered dwarves you have. Adding war-dogs will protect them, but the bads thougt of dead pets might cause tantruming. But unassigned war-animals will always follor their trainer. This way you can protect your woodcutters and keep your wardogs free for other assignments if needed.</p>
		<p><strong>18. The trade depot has an alternate setting for finding tradegoods.</strong></p>
		<p>You can sort by distance (default) or by value, or even find by name. Just look at the hotkeys in the bottom of the tradescreen. This saves a lot of time.</p>
		<p><strong>19. Trade ways</strong></p>
		<p>By pressing D you can see if a 3-tile path is aviable from the map edge to your trade depot. Although wagons do not work in the current version (31.25) it is still possible to control the caravan spawn point. If you have only one path aviable from depot to edge, the caravan will always spawn there. Makes it easy to protect them from ambushes/invaders,</p>
		<p><strong>20. Dodge traps</strong></p>
		<p>Almost an exploit, you could build weapon traps on a 1-tile wide floor, with open space on both sides. Imagine a long, narrow bridge made of floor-tiles, covered in weapon traps. Creatures that step on the traps will try to dodge and fall into the pit next to them. This is extremly effective. Most useful when a natural pit is aviable, like a river.</p>
		<p><strong>21. Wildlife traps</strong></p>
		<p>Free roaming animals will almost never get into one of your cagetraps. To increase the change build a gaint X on the map made of walls. Leave the center tile free, so animals can path through it. Then build cagetraps in the center. The larger the X, the higher the change for a catch. Will also work for ambushers and invaders.</p>
		<p><strong> 22. Metal Furniture</strong></p>
		<p>Metal furniture can be built by a mason out of the metal. No need for a forge and coal. Uses the mason skill. You have to enable the material first in the Stone screen. Press z and go to Stones at the top.</p>
		<p><strong>23. Deadly Ice</strong></p>
		<p>If you have frozen rivers or lakes and want to avoid drowning dwarves in spring, go to the traffic designations, d-o-r, and mark all ice as restricted. Dwarves will now walk around it.</p>
		<p><strong>24. Tree growth</strong></p>
		<p>If you want to prevent trees from growing in your soil and clay corridors, create a stockpile with no goods enabled over them. Plants will no longer grow there, but take care: As soon as you remove the stockpile all trees that did grow invisible underneath it will pop up instantly.</p>
		<p><strong>25. Spoiler Material â€“ Read with care</strong></p>
		<p>If you ever happen to have a blue metallic thread in your possesion, take care to limit access to it. Doctors will use it to suture patients.If you ever happen to find a blue masterpiece weapon on your map, construct a floor in front of it. The weapon can be deconstructed like a building and claimed for your army. But beware, if you build the floor, you will rob yourself of fun.</p>
		<p><strong>Honorable mention: Danger Room</strong></p>
		<p>A danger room is a small 3x3 â€“ 5x5 room full of upright spike traps, filled with wooden training spears. Linked to a lever that has: Pull the lever (R) activated this causes everyone stationed in the room to learn combat skills very fast. Be careful not to station mothers with babys or petowners in the room. A locked door helps keeping people in longer. Quite a few people regard this as an exploit, since your dwarfs become overpowered.</p>
		<p>PS: I buffed the dangerroom in the mod, so use it with care. It might be more dangerous then you remember.</p>

	<p><a href="javascript:toggle('hidden4')"><span class="style1"><strong>Click to show Kobold-Specific Tips</strong></span></a>
	<div id="hidden4" style="display:none;">
		<h1><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Kobold Tips and Tricks</a></h1>
		<p><strong>1.</strong> Embark on caves. Its 100 times more fun.</p>
		<p><strong>2.</strong> Bring Jack Rats. They give birth to 3 - 5 babies each. Seriously, dont embark without a ton of animals to butcher for leather.</p>
		<p><strong>3.</strong> Trap Spiders can web your traps, which capture even trap-avoid creatures. Be wary of friendly fire, your Kobolds can get webbed too.</p>
		<p><strong>4.</strong> Kobolds dont need alcohol. Water is perfectly fine.</p>
		<p><strong>5.</strong> Kobolds do need meat. They wont eat plants at all. Farming is only for ingredients, not your main food source.</p>
		<p><strong>6.</strong> Clay. One tile of clay gives unlimited boulders. You only need a kiln to issue the &quot;collect clay&quot; labor. Then make a zone:clay to start collecting. Unlimited clay boulders for everyone.</p>
		<p><strong>7.</strong> Woodstalks are important. So is the entire wood industry.</p>
		<p><strong>8.</strong> Metal, coal and gems are very, very hard to come by. Moods might get very difficult to handle. Bonemold is the only metal you can create yourself.</p>
		<p><strong>9.</strong> Kobolds are tiny. Avoid melee combat.</p>
		<p><strong>10.</strong> Stealing from other civs is a high-risk, high-reward option. Many items can only be gained through thievery, like metals or gems.</p>
		<p><strong>11</strong>. You can dig surprisingly deep if you dig veins and rubble using up/downstairs instead of digging. Every dug tile will show you the tile underneath it, which makes it easier to find other metal veins, gems and more rubble patches. Usually it is possible to reach the caverns this way.</p>
		<p><strong>12</strong>. Thin suede is your friend. Dont have enough leather for buildings? Remember that you can cut each piece of leather into 3 pieces of suede. Useless as armor material, its still good enough for tents. This triples your leather amount.</p>
		<p><strong>13</strong>. The bite of the psychotropic toad also carries all these random syndromes. Maybe it makes sense to war-train them, for some special surprise.</p>
		<p><strong>14</strong>. Using magical boosts, warpainted armor, tattoos and good metal-gear, your late-game kobolds can hold their own in melee. Just because most of the game you do hide behind ogres and shoot poisoned ammo, doesnt mean that you cant upgrade to actual close-combat once you have the ability to do so. And remember, kobolds come cheap.</p>

	<p><a href="javascript:toggle('hidden6')"><span class="style1"><strong>Click to show Succubus-Specific Tips</strong></span></a>
	<div id="hidden6" style="display:none;">
		<h1><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Succubus Tips and Tricks</a></h1></p>
		<strong>1. Upgrading your fighters</strong></p>
		<p>Elite succubi are not only excellent dodgers and strickers, they can also bring powerful spells to the field. You can use the workshop profile
		(shift + P) to select who gets the upgrade. They do not require an enabled job.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>While Gehenna fire provides good fire attacks, Torrid kiss is a free action and will burn your enemies without interrupting melee attacks.</li>
			<li>Berserk rage is more effective if the fighter is miserable but still have effect if the fighter is happy. It can be combined with Martial Excitation.</li>
			<li>Learning the secrets of lust provide area of effect buffs and dimming interactions. At regular intervals, the courtesans will blink, meaning that their combat abilities are multiplied.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>2. Clearing sieges</strong></p>
		<p>It is important to clear sieges before late spring to allow your civilization's caravan to visit you, otherwise you will not receive migrants for a year. There is a few rituals that can help you :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sow discord (6 souls) will cause infighting among the invaders. This is the quickest way to get rid of a squad of enemies.</li>
			<li>Lure invaders (1 soul) will break camps and call all the invaders into your traps.</li>
			<li>Conjure fire storm (temple of fire, 1 soul) have a decent chance to burn enemies outside. It is especially good if your fighters are fireborn.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>3. Fire immunity</strong></p>
		<p>The temple of fire provides fire - and cold - immunity. You can use that to channel magma, work on glaciers, throw burning attacks safely or play in the forest fires.</p>
		<p>If a succubus can be fire immune, her clothes will not be. To avoid accidents, military uniforms made of fire safe materiel can help you. Or you can assign an empty uniform in 'replace clothing' mode, the succubi are much less affected by the lack of clothing.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Do not forget that you can still drown in magma.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Evil biomes</strong></p>
		<p>On the surface of evil biomes, you can pick black roses and bloodworms.
		Wine made from those plants will have positive effect on your succubi.</p>
		<p>If your civilization has settled on evil biomes, you will also be able to buy those plants from the carvans.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Adventuring as a succubus</strong></p>
		<p>There is plenty of caste choices as an adventurer. Half breed all have their perks, and fireborn succubi can swim in magma. Use the gender selection before starting your adventures to switch castes.</p>
		<p>If you look at the civilization's border before starting, you will likely find forts with succubi soldiers to recruit inside. After completing a few quest, the local lady will give you more tasks, allowing you to work for your civilization instead of humans.</p>
