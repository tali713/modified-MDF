	<h1>Getting Started</h1>
	<p><strong>Before you embark:</strong> Make sure you have every setting the way you like it. Remember that the mod allows you to alter embark point and group size to your liking, and that you can embark on towns, tombs and fortresses using embark anywhere.</p>
	<p>I personally embark with a lot of miners, but the embark preparation in MDF is not different from vanilla DF. </p>
	<p><strong>After the embark:</strong> Again, MDF dwarves start of just like vanilla DF dwarves, so there is nothing special you need right away. You do have a few workshops that make a fortress easier to set up though, the rock/gemforges and the 4 crafters. Stonecutter, Woodcrafter, Bonecarver and Gemcutter allow much more efficient use of these materials. </p>
	<p>You might want a wood-splitting block at the early game, as well as an ore processor. They raise your yield of wood and metals.</p>
	<p>Buildings moats and walls, traps and siege engines, or a standing army: thats your choice. There are not many changes to vanilla DF, all your old tactics will work here as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong> The later stages are where the mod content comes to shine. You can create metalworks several times the size of the ones you might be used to, upgrade your weapons, maybe dabble in rune engravings. Magma allows the forging of new alloys; libraries quickly train up your migrants. Golems are high-end fighters, or you create an alchemist to transumte metals. Your choice. ;)</p>
