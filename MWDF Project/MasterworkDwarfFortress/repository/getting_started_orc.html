	<h1>Getting Started</h1>
	<p><strong>Before world generation:  </strong></p>
	<p>The default world gen settings will give you a moderately easy first couple years, with several trading partners helping to guard your outpost and boost your economy. If you are looking for a tougher challenge for your Orcish warriors, you might choose to limit contact to ~1 friendly trade partner (for example, the goblins).</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Before you embark: </strong></p>
	<p>Orcs are equally at home above or below the surface, so bring picks and axes of course. Orcish tribal gear uses a lot of leather, bones, and ash, so it's a good idea to get hunting (bring leather for quivers) or ranching going fairly quickly too. You don't need a lot of booze since orcs aren't alcohol dependent, and you don't really need an anvil since the Tribal Warcrafter workshop can provide without. Check the castes of your starting 7 for specialists. If you start with an Artisan, (Dreamwalker, Corsair), you don't need to invest embark points in crafting (medicine, appraising).</p>
	<p>The included embark profiles can get you off to a quick start. The Goals and Tips in the scenarios below are designed to give an introduction to some of the features in Orc Fortress. Use any extra points to get a pack of Orcish Direwolves for hunting and guard duty, or Steppe Aurochs for ranching. Get some Arctic Condors or Terrier Squigs for vermin control.</p>

		<hr /><h3>Vale of Tears</h3>
		<p>His name was once legend among your clan - Aguur'thashum, the Black Arrow. He came up through the ranks as a line grunt in a resistance warband protecting the last of the Orcish Druids' Places of Power. When the deep forests were finally lost to the elves, he lead a battered and rag-tag group in a desperate battle for survival, leaving only ash in their wake. Ultimately, he found himself hunting alone in the darkest corners of the elder kingdoms, striking at Elven princelings with single arrows fletched with ravens' plumes. Now the Black Arrow is a shadow of his former self, blind with age and crippled with old scars, and forgotten by many of the young warchiefs vying for favor. He has cashed in all his remaining favors with the Clan Council to outfit one final expedition and counts on you to see it through. The time for subtlety, for knives in the dark, has passed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Goals: Embark with the "Forest Clan" profile in a region with both Elves and</li>
			<li><p>Elven Bandits. Initiate war with both. Build a camp with at least 3 Elven Labor Cells and 1 Goblin Sawmill. Build an above ground temple exclusively from wood and embellished with mithril, large enough for a Stone Circle and 3 totem poles, and housing. House in the temple at least 3 Druids, plus their assistant Dreamwalkers and any other worthy acolytes you see fit.</p></li>
			<li><p>Tips: Use the Raiders Drydock to get Elven laborers and Goblin migrants. A Druidic codex can be either crafted or obtained on a raid; then use it at the Stone Circle to enlighten your Dreamwalkers. </p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 1: Burn, melt, butcher, or destroy any items looted from elvish invaders or stolen from traders (using Raiders' plunder is fair game). </p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 2: Capture a Treesinger's Pagoda and ensnare the ancient spirits of the forest to give fairwood and mithril as tribute for the temple.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The Old Ways</h3>
		<p>When the enemy marched on the Great Clanholding, your kin held the pass at Bitter Narrows for hours. The entire council of elders escaped, and you held the ford. The other supposed "warlords" escaped, and still your folk alone held the ford. In the end your father sent you away with an oath to safeguard the clan in his stead. He fell fighting back to back with his brothers, after exacting a terrible toll from the human vanguard. A near escape and a long bitter winter followed, but of course, you endured. Yesterday, a clan liaison arrived to announce that due to your greatly diminished numbers, your clan-holding was being dissolved. Your kin are to disperse into the towns. You are to report for training as a shieldbearer second-class in support of a new professional pike-and-musket battalion, modeled after some human tactical nonsense. Today, the liaison woke up at sunrise, confused and alone in his fine silken tent. You, your tribe, and your herds were visible only as a cloud of dust on the horizon.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Goals: Embark with the "Steppe Clan" profile. Equip at least 15 soldiers with gear from the traditional Jaguar, Falcon, or Dragon Warrior Societies. Record 50 or more kills of Human or Dwarven troops in melee or with ranged attacks from Society wargear. All snaga-caste orcs must live in a separate complex and are forbidden from melee combat, crafting, and metalworking. </p></li>
			<li><p>Tips: Use the Tribal wargear, Fletcher, Damasc shop, and/or Forge to craft traditional weapons, and combine them into Society Wargear at the meadhall. </p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 1: Embark on an aquifer (you may adjust the embark to bring stone)</p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 2: Since you are estranged from the central Clan Council, set the population cap to 80 or less.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Thunderguard</h3>
		<p>Your clan traces its lineage back to the Orcish Sorcerer-kings of the deep. When you were young, your great-uncle would unlock the old stockpiles to show you the mechanized crossbows, the automata, the black powder and strange runic weapons. But your uncle was no sorcerer, nor even a mechanist, and the ancient weapons were rusted and decrepit after long decades of neglect. In any case the stockpiles were lost to the Drow years ago in the Underdark wars. Your clan is now diminished almost to a feral pack of animals, scavenging for scraps in the moonlight, hiding in caves from Human outriders from dawn to dusk. You agree with your cousin, the chief, on a desperate mission: you will take a small team of picked Orcs, build a secret holding deep below the hills, and rebuild a devastating arsenal in relative safety. Only once you have the strength to finally break your enemies will you reveal yourself to the surface world again.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Goals: Embark with the "Mountain Clan" profile in a region without Human Bandit trade partners. Delve directly to the 1st or 2nd cavern; anything built above the 1st cavern must be made of Factory-produced blocks, metal, or obsidian. Equip at least 20 soldiers with gunpowder weapons including at least 5 Seawolf or Lifeguard Society arms kits. Ultimately build an citadel and obelisk on the surface as a beacon for your scattered clan.</p></li>
			<li><p>Tips: Buy ammo at the Freelancers' Guild or craft it at the Goblin Tinkerer. Gunpowder weapons are available at the Freelancer or Tinkerer; by raiding Humans and Merchants Guild, or by loot in ordinary combat.</p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 1: Build an Altar of Storms and train 2 or more Sorcerers to support the Thunderguard.</p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 2: Capture a Heavy Weapons Armory and destroy at least 10 enemies with cannons' Grenade ammo or steam-powered melee weapons.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Blood Price</h3>
		<p>You are a favored privateer and bounty hunter of the Shadowbroker. Or, you were, as recently as 12 hours ago. Currently the Broker's second-best galleon lies broken on the strand, all the treasure in her hold lost to the depths, with only a drunken posse of goblinoid halfwits blinking at you for orders. Already you are doing your best to hatch some schemes - the <em>Trinimac's Revenge</em> will never sail again, so you might as well start salvaging. You suppose that the Broker can be reasonable, particularly if he never finds out what actually happened. </p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Goals: Embark with the "Shipwrecked Longboat" profile. Build a pirate cove consisting of a waterfront villa, at least 2 raider's drydocks, 2 freelancer's guildhalls, and one of each type of caravanserai bazaar. Cover your debt by acquiring at least 20,000 platinum coins, plus an additional 5000 for each elapsed game year.</p></li>
			<li><p>Tips: Use the Raider's docks to capture caravanserai blueprints; use the Common Bazaar and Shadowbroker's Bazaar to combine smaller currencies to gold and platinum.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Bonus 1: As a known pirate, coins with your mark are practically worthless; you may not mint coins at the forge.</p></li>
			<li><p>Bonus 2: Rebuild the Shadowbroker's Galleon, a fortress suspended above the waves with housing for at least 7, galley, sickbay, barracks, captain's quarters, and a ballista.</p></li>
		</ul>

	<p><strong>After the embark:</strong> </p>
	<p>Set up a basic camp with some secure living quarters, food supply, and carpenter/mason/craftsorc. The still can wait if you have fresh water, although booze is still good in the long run. Get multiple butchers and tanners running, and as soon as you have hides build leatherworker and the first two unique orcish buildings: Tribal Warcrafter and Fletcher. Start production of lamellar leather for shields for your whole warband, and armor for your most promising warriors. Add an ash and bonemeal supply from burning wood and the amputation theatre; use leather, ash, and bonemeal to create some bonemold weapons at the Warcrafter.</p>
	<p>Choose weapons that suit your warband. Common orcs will usually do their best with an orcish axe or sword. Uruks can use great weapons one-handed, like the macuahuitl or greataxe. Ologs will be great with any heavy weapon including a polearm, club or maul. Snaga will do well with a composite bow from the fletcher. Mix in some war-claws, jagged spears, or bladed chains if you face large or armored enemies for piercing damage. For extra flexibility you can create combination weapons like the tomahawk, which allows you to fight in melee with axe and shield and also carry a quiver of throwing tomahawks.</p>
	<p>Assign a speaker, shaman (psych/doctor), and scribe (accountant/manager) and equip their rooms. You can add more shamans and scribes later as needed. Churn out some crafts for trade but hold on to totems -- you might find them more valuable as bounties for the Freelancers guild to jumpstart your raiding.</p>
	<p><strong>Mid game: </strong></p>
	<p>If you start metalworking, get an Orcish Molten Pit for batch processing. You can also use it to &quot;re-size&quot; small armor, like mithril armor taken from the corpses of elvish invaders. Use an Orcish Factory to churn out blocks from clay or ash for above ground building. Once you have access to massive quantities of enemies to butcher, add extraction of blood to barrels in your meat-works, and add Boneforges to create bars of bonemold and bloodsteel that can be used at your forges.</p>
	<p>Start your raiding industry by building a siege workshop and Freelancer's guild, and cutting down several trees. (Farming wood stalks or trade can help). Forge or factory-produce cheap weapons like copper daggers. Craft ballista parts. Trade for bonemold coins at the Freelancer's Guild. Build a Raider Drydock and send some expeditions for Goblin and Kobold migrant workers. These workers are &quot;tools&quot; that can be used to unlock some useful workshops in the &quot;Outlander's Ghetto&quot;. If you have enough resources, move on to the riskier raids to supplement your own productions. You can loot unique foriegn weapons like warhammers and muskets, and blueprints or captives that unlock a variety of new buildings, but be aware that you are more likely to lose your ships and even have a chance to suffer a counterattack against your fort.</p>
	<p><strong>Late game:  </strong></p>
	<p>Once you have a good quantity of skulls, start making totems at the craftsorc and build an Outpost, then upgrade it to a Warrior's Outpost. Your elite warriors can create powerful weapon kits with special melee and ranged attacks (try the Jaguar Society for your Uruks and the Seawolf Society for your Corsairs). If you have access to brass, fuel, rocksalt, or saltpeter you might want to explore gunpowder weapons and heavy industry: start by adding a Goblin Tinkerer or a Blacksmoke Foundry and trying out their reactions. If you have plenty of mithril or wolfram, you might want to add a Damasc Forge, where your best forgeorcs can make powerful elegant melee and throwing weapons.</p>
	<p>There are a number of foreign buildings that you might find yourself interested in as well. The ghetto buildings can improve mass production of furniture, and the goblin thief and kobold poisoner, while not critical, can give you some unique additions to your playstyle. The Ashland Glassworks can also produce some high-end weaponry, if you can supply it with the correct reagents. Keep an eye out, though, for the plans for the Ancient Foundry, which will allow you to make some special high-end weapons-grade materials.</p>
