	<p>The Pottery shapes and dries clay items. You can make clay, fire clay and kaolinite items from the collected raw materials, resulting in greenware items. Greenware is a special name for wet clay. The workshop will automatically queue two drying reactions, from greenware to leather-hard, from leather-hard to bone-dry. The items can not be used until they are fired in the Clay Oven.</p>
	<p>To make it simpler: Shape Item =&gt; Dry =&gt; Dry =&gt; Fire Item.</p>
	<p>The material progression is: Clay =&gt; Greenware =&gt; Leather-Hard =&gt; Bone-Dry =&gt; Ceramic</p>
	<p>Each reaction has a 5% chance to fail, simulating impurities in the clay.
