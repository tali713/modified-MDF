# modified MWDF for mac
modified master work dwarf fortress


This is the amostubal produced variant of masterwork dwarf fortress, it is updated to 43.05 x64, and has many fixes implemented over the last 2 months since its production.  the product is still considered to be owned by Meph and this will be deleted upon his request.

This is a fork of Amoustubal's 64x MWDF with some support for Macs.  Sorry, no launcher/configuration tool, but you can either run the windows version from a shared folder in a VM or launch it via wine and it will work for configuring, though you will still need to launch dwarf fortress manually via dfhack.  A cross platform configuration tool would be great, but that will take some time.

This is the dev branch, expect the unexpected.
