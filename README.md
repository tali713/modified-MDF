# modified MWDF for mac
modified master work dwarf fortress

This is the amostubal produced variant of masterwork dwarf fortress, began on March 16, 2017. 

Short history: 
This variant was based off of the v1.23 of masterwork by meph last updated on December 09,2016. 
Since then we have updated the Df game engine to 43.05 x64.  Additionally, we've been updating all the extras from DFHack to the graphic files...  Many fixes have been made and the code now is very stable compared to when we started.

Additionally we have upgraded the launcher to fix many of the bugs that were in its code, and added many new features to improve the game experience!

This is a fork of Amoustubal's 64x MWDF with some support for Macs.  Sorry, no launcher/configuration tool, but you can either run the windows version from a shared folder in a VM or launch it via wine and it will work for configuring, though you will still need to launch dwarf fortress manually via dfhack.  A cross platform configuration tool would be great, but that will take some time.

This is the dev branch, expect the unexpected.
